### Reproducing results under high-dimensional Markovian models.
- run `sim_lasso.py` to generate simulation results.
- run `plots.ipynb` to visualize the results.

### Reproducing results under model misspecification.
- run `sim_misspec.py` to generate simulation results.
- run `plots.ipynb` to visualize the results.
