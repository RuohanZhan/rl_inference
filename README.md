### Reproducing results under high-dimensional Markovian models.
- run `gmm_lasso.py` to generate simulation results for GMM estimations.
- run `sim_lasso.py` to generate simulation results for Z-estimations.
- run `plots_GMM.ipynb` to visualize the results for GMM.
- run `plots.ipynb` to visualize the results for Z-estimation.

### Reproducing results under model misspecification.
- run `gmm_misspec.py` to generate simulation results for GMM estimations.
- run `sim_misspec.py` to generate simulation results for Z-estimations.
- run `plots)GMM.ipynb` to visualize the results for GMM estimations.
- run `plots.ipynb` to visualize the results for Z-estimations.
